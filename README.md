# Design Patterns

These are design patterns in their simplest form.
Currently the **bold** items are ones I have examples for.

More will come later on.

- abstract_factory
- adapter
- **builder**
- decorator
- facade
- **factory**
- front_controller
- **memento**
- **observer**
- **prototype**
- proxy
- **singleton**

## About the Patterns
This is made to understand patterns as simple as possible. So here are a few things to know:

- Notes are provided in the class.
- Examples are provided at the bottom of the class.
- The name of the pattern is the name of the class.
- Classes not requiring Abstract Classes and Interfaces are not included to keep it simple.
- You would generally:
  - Change the actual name of the class(es).
  - Put classes in separate files.
